/**
 * `runPipeline` — single-function orchestrator that wires the Phase 5.1–5.5
 * stages into the end-to-end sequence per `docs/system-design.md`
 * § End-to-end sequence:
 *
 *   1. Resolve an `OctokitLike` for the installation (or use `deps.octokit`).
 *   2. Fetch the PR snapshot.
 *   3. Run the prefilter; on `oversized` short-circuit to a summary-only
 *      publication per `docs/publication-policy.md` § Diff too large.
 *   4. Call the provider; classify the throwable per
 *      `docs/system-design.md` § Error taxonomy mapping.
 *   5. Run the validator and ranker.
 *   6. Publish.
 *
 * The function is the only place that knows about the queue framework's
 * retry policy: it re-throws transient and rate-limited errors so the
 * caller (the BullMQ consumer) can apply exponential backoff. Non-transient
 * errors (auth/capability/schema_validation) are handled here so the user
 * sees a "review unavailable" Checks run before the job marks terminal.
 *
 * Logging discipline (per `docs/observability.md`):
 *   - One event per stage: prefilter.{accepted,skipped}, provider.{called,error},
 *     validator.rejected, ranker.dropped, publisher.{published,dropped}.
 *   - `traceparent` from the JobPayload is propagated to every log entry.
 *   - No raw provider output, finding text, or diff content is logged.
